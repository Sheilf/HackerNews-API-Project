React Hooks are really good at making concise components. It seems like a great way to turn up React to 11 in the way it handles things for simple and stable components. 

In a nutshell, I want to explore these more to handle more complex components. The only downside seems like it's very Reacty and would be challenging to share with people that come from other programming styles while props and state are rather straightforward to compare and follow.

I want to be careful about the React custom open source hooks like firebase-react-hooks or other hook tooling - it adds a layer of maintenance (React-> React Hook Dependencies -> Custom Hooks). That is a sudden 2 steps away from writing in plain React. I will treat React Hooks similar to how I treat React Portals for now, although the use cases for Hooks are abundantly clear - it makes lifecycle management easier and lifecycles are something you deal with more in react writing than you do with Portals.
